<main>
  <p>My name is Kim and I am from Northern California. I have lived in Seattle for 28 years. This is the first city I lived in as an adult and I liked it so much I stayed here. I have seen many changes in Seattle over the years and I think I choose the best neighborhood for me to live in, West Seattle. I have lived there for 15 years.  I have one dog is is a black lab. He currently weighs about 60 pounds. I also have a cat. 
    I work as a registered nurse and have for about 16 years. I have worked in hospitals, home health, education and training and infusion therapy. I have an Associates degree in nursing and have had had chemotherapy certification in the past. My current additional certification is certified registered nurse of infusion. 
  I have seen a lot of change and flux in healthcare. This is part of the reason that I am some interested in software development. I also want to try something knew and I believe that this is a stable career to be in. I am currently enrolled in classes at Code Fellows in Seattle. </p>
